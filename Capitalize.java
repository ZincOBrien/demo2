		//input = stringArray[i];
		//need to figure out how to read the variable input out one character at a time but I dont know how so im stuck again
	}
	
	
	
	// OK so clearly Ill just try to explain what else I would do as I'm hung up here. I think i would try to turn the 
	//string variable into a char one and then go through it letter by letter. first checking each character to
	//see if it was a space. if it was a space then I would select the next letter to be capitalized by
	//using the Character.toUpperCase. When i went through the whole thing I would convert it back into a string 
	// somehow and return the value as my output variable.
	//points of failure: 1. can't pass the string input variable in
	//2. cant convert from string to char
	//3. most of the body of the method is basically impossible to work on
		 
		System.out.println("input is: " + input);
		
		// do something to input ????????
		// both functions given on the page are for char data type and are useless wtf?
		
		String output = "output";
		return output;
